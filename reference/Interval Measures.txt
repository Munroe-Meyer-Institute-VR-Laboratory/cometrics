Frequency Keys Partial Interval Agreement Percentage (PIA)
	For each interval, x = smaller value / larger value
	If both reliability and primary have zero value, then x = 1
	Partial Interval Agreement = average all x values * 100

Frequency Keys Occurrence Interval Agreement Percentage (OIA)
	Given that one observer scored 1 or more for an interval, agreement if both scored at least 1
	If both observers recorded zero responses, the interval is excluded
	Occurrence Interval Agreement = agreements / (agreements + disagreements) * 100

Frequency Keys NonOccurrence Interval Agreement Percentage (NIA)
	Given that one scored 0 for an interval, agreement if both scored 0
	If both observers recorded at least one response in the interval, then the interval is excluded
	NonOccurrence Interval Agreement = agreements / (agreements + disagreements) * 100

Frequency Keys Exact Agreement Percentage (EIA)
	Agreement is scored if both primary and reli have same value for an interval.
	Exact Agreement Percentage = total agreements / total intervals * 100

Frequency Keys Total Agreement Percentage (TIA)
	Agreement = # of intervals where both scored zero or > 1
	Total agreement = number of agreements / total intervals * 100

Duration Keys Partial Interval Agreement Percentage (PIA)
	For each interval, x = smaller value / larger value
	If both reli and primary have zero value, then x = 1 
	Partial Interval Agreement = the average of all x values * 100

Duration Keys Exact Interval Agreement Percentage (EIA)
	For each interval the value of the primary and reli is rounded to the nearest second
	Agreement is scored if both primary and reli have same value for an interval.
	Exact Agreement Percentage = total agreements / total intervals * 100
