# Introduction 
Cometrics is a Windows-based computer program that allows for the real-time coregistration of frequency- and duration-based behavior metrics, physiological signals from an Empatica E4, and video data.  It has been designed to integrate directly into the workflow of the Severe Behavior Clinic at the Munroe-Meyer Institute in the University of Nebraska Medical Center, while simplifying multiple manual steps into a few mouse clicks.  By using a tracker spreadsheet, an entire patient's history can be collected into a single document from the software with your own specified graphs and format within that spreadsheet.  You can find an example of a tracker spreadsheet [here](https://github.com/Munroe-Meyer-Institute-VR-Laboratory/cometrics/blob/main/reference/Reference_Tracker.xlsx).
