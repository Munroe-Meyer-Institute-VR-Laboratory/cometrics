# Privacy Policy for cometrics
## Date: Aug 2022

The developer of cometrics is mindful of the security and protection of user data and patient data.  This Privacy Policy document explains the types of information that are collected and recorded by cometrics and in which situations the developers will have access to generated data.

By using cometrics, you hereby consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms and conditions.

## Information cometrics collects

Cometrics automatically collects computer resource usage, file names, and errors encountered into standard log files that are stored on the computer that cometrics is installed on.  Only users of that computer with appropriate privileges can view these records.

Cometrics, as part of its functionality, will log and record keystroke information, behavioral data, physiological data, control parameters for external devices, session dates and times, and, possibly, personally identifiable information about a patient that falls under HIPAA restrictions.  Cometrics saves this data in the location specified by the user in the creation of their project.  This may or may not be a shared computer network or server system that other users have access to.  This data can only be accessed by users with permissions to access the data folders on the computer system it is stored on.  Cometrics does not send this data to any person or computer system other than the computer system pointed to by the user.  

Cometrics does not log or transmit any usage data, user data, or patient data to any server or computer system that is under the control of the developer or visible to any other third party.  

## How is data collected

Feedback data is sent and stored on https://github.com in our public code repository located at https://github.com/Munroe-Meyer-Institute-VR-Laboratory/cometrics.  This data is public and includes the feedback text, feedback type, and feedback title that is provided using the built-in submission user interface in cometrics.

## Why is this data collected

This feedback data is collected and stored publicly on our public code repository to improve the functionality of cometrics and provide semi-anonymized feedback with minimal user friction.  This data allows the developer and maintainer of cometrics to isolate, identify, and resolve problems that are affecting the user base. 

## Who can see this collected data

This data is public and accessible by any individual with an internet capable computing device.

## When is this data collected

This data is only collected by voluntarily submitting feedback through the built-in feedback function within cometrics.

## Where is this data stored

Submitted feedback can be found and monitored here https://github.com/Munroe-Meyer-Institute-VR-Laboratory/cometrics/issues.

## Third parties

No data is sold, shared, or controlled by third parties.  

## When will data be deleted

Data will be deleted if it is determined that the feedback contains personally identifiable information as it relates to patient data, private usernames, or private logins.  If a request is made to remove feedback, it will be deleted within a month.  Requests can be made to wsarcera@gmail.com.

## CCPA Privacy Rights (Do Not Sell My Personal Information)

Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to:
